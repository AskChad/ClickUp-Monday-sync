   - Get API keys

2. **Configure OAuth**
   - Register apps with ClickUp and Monday
   - Get client IDs and secrets

3. **Deploy**
   - Deploy to Vercel/Netlify
   - Set environment variables
   - Test authentication flows

4. **Optional Enhancements**
   - Add Supabase Auth integration
   - Build comprehensive UI
   - Add real-time progress components
   - Implement webhook support

## 💡 Technical Decisions

### Why Next.js 14?
- App Router for better performance
- Built-in API routes
- Server-side rendering capabilities
- TypeScript support
- Easy deployment

### Why Supabase?
- PostgreSQL with great performance
- Row Level Security
- Built-in authentication
- Real-time capabilities
- Free tier for development

### Why TypeScript?
- Type safety prevents bugs
- Better IDE support
- Self-documenting code
- Easier refactoring
- Industry standard

### Design Patterns Used
- Repository pattern for data access
- Factory pattern for API clients
- Strategy pattern for field mapping
- Observer pattern for progress tracking
- Singleton pattern for rate limiters

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:
- Production-grade Node.js/TypeScript development
- RESTful and GraphQL API integration
- Complex data transformation
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Async batch processing
- Database design and optimization
- Security best practices
- Clean architecture principles

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- **Rate Limiting**: Respects API limits to avoid bans
- **Batch Processing**: Prevents memory overload
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking background jobs
- **Database Indexing**: Fast queries on large datasets
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connections

## 🔒 Security Considerations
